Shakshuka

2 tbsp, olive oil
2 tbsp, harissa
2 tsp, tomato paste
2, large red peppers, cut into 1/4 inch (2 cups)
4 cloves, garlic, finely chopped
1 tsp, ground cumin
5, large tomatoes, chopped or canned
8, large eggs, with 4 of the yolks separated
1/2 cup, yogurt
3/4 tbsp, salt

Heat the OO in a pan over medium heat and add harissa, tomato paste, peppers, garlic, cumin, and 3/4 tbsp salt. Stir and cook over medium heat for 8 minutes. Add tomatoes, bring to gentle simmer, and cook for 10 more minutes. Taste for seasoning.

Make 8 little dips in the sauce. Gently break eggs and pour each into its own dip. Do the same with the yolks. Use fork to swirl egg whites a little bit with the sauce, taking care not to break yolks. Simmer gently for 8-10 minutes, until egg whites are set but yolks are still runny. (You can cover pan with lid to speed up the process.)  Remove from heat, leave for 2 minutes, then spoon into plates and serve with yogurt.
