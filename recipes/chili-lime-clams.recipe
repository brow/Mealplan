Chile-Lime Clams with Tomatoes

6 tbsp, butter
2, shallot
4 cloves, garlic, thinly sliced
1 tbsp, tomato paste
1 cup, beer
1 cup, cherry tomato
1 15.5 oz can, chickpea, rinsed
2 tbsp, sambal oelek
50, clam
1 tbsp, lime juice
1/2 cup, fresh cilantro, chopped

Serves 4

In large skillet melt 4 tbsp butter. Add shallots and garlic and cook, stirring often, until soft, about 4 minutes.

Add tomato paste and cook, stirring often, until paste darkens to a rich brick-red color, about 1 minute.

Add beer and tomatoes. Bring to a boil and cook until beer is reduced nearly by half and no longer smells boozy, about 4 minutes.

Stir in chickpeas and sambal oelek, then add clams. Cover (if you don’t have a lid that fits, use a sheet of foil) and cook, stirring occasionally, until clams have opened; this could take from 5–10 minutes.

Remove from heat; discard any clams that don’t open. Stir in lime juice and remaining 2 Tbsp. butter.

Serve topped with cilantro and with lime wedges.
